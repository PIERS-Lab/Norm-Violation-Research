Hello! This github contains all of the custom behaviors and functions for any robots used in the Delivery Debacles study.

### A brief study description:
  The robots are expected to be able to participate in a simple game where they "own" an object and bring it to the designated location (specific mechanics are still being developed), 
  They will do this alongside a human participant so we can study people's thoughts and reactions to working with the robots in a team setting.
  
The Goal is to both get the robot working to:
  
  - Recognize an object and be able to ID it.	
  - Be able to bring said object to a specific point that It can Recognize.
  - Have a variety of different behaviors for the robot to use, so we can see how reactions change between the different ways that the robot conducts itself during the game.
  - Do all of the above while having at least 2 robots working simultaneously. 

Current robots in scope:

  - Cozmo- Primary robot
  - Vector- In consideration
  - Vex Aim- Possible alternative to Cozmo


Due to all of the cozmo libraries being written in python, this project is going to be using it for most of the code.

Thank you for your interest in this research!
